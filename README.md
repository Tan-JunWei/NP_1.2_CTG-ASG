# CTG (Cryptography)

CTG is a module in Semester 1.2 of the Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics (CSF) course in Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP). This module covers the essential concepts of Cryptography, including Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 
Digital Signature and Certificate, and the various encryption/decryption algorithms.

This GitHub repository contains the Python script written for the module's assignment, where teams are expected to implement a simulated working prototype that would depict the operations and workings of the cryptographic algorithms.
This cryptosystem  aims to fufil the 5 goals of Cryptography, namely _Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication and Non-repudiation_.

## Overview of Cryptographic Goals
- Confidentiality: Ensuring that only authorized parties can access the information
- Integrity: Verifying that the information has not been altered during transmission
- Availability: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information when needed
- Authentication: Verifying the identity of the parties involved in communication
- Non-repudiation: Ensuring that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document

# How the cryptosystem works

This cryptosystem includes the implementation of:
- **Symmetric Cryptosystem**: Kuznyechik ("Grasshopper") - Symmetric Block Cipher
- **Asymmetric Cryptosystem**: ElGamal Encryption System
- **Cryptographic Hash Function**: BLAKE2b
